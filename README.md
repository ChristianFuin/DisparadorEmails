This application was created to solve the problem that the company I used to work for had been facing. With it's old system unable to
send emails to the employees, they had to call the staff who new tasks were designated to keeping them busy, such a hassle, right?

MailThrower was developed to solve that problem sending mails to people who were chosen to do some task, it reads a file generated by 
another system and then send the mails.

Developed in Java 7
